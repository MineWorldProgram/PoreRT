# Pore Returned [![Build Status](https://jenkins.maxqia.com/job/PoreRT/badge/icon)](https://jenkins.maxqia.com/job/PoreRT/)

Pore was a plugin for the up-and-coming SpongeAPI built to provide compatibility for Bukkit plugins on the platform.
This is a continuation of Pore to add more features and update it for 1.10 (and beyond hopefully).
Please note that this project is still under heavy development and **is not yet considered functional**.  The [statuses of plugins](https://github.com/Maxqia/PoreRT/wiki/Statuses-of-Plugins) wiki page has the statuses of some of the plugins I've tested. If you have a plugin that you would like to be supported and currently doesn't work correctly, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/Maxqia/PoreRT/issues).

## Running PoreRT on Your Sponge Server
<sup>**Warning** : The "bukkit-plugins" directory from previous versions of Pore has been moved to the "plugins" directory</sup>

If you like living on the bleeding edge and want to give Pore a try:

1. Back up your existing system.
2. Install [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.spongepowered.org/en/server/getting-started/) .
3. Copy the [PoreRT Snapshot](https://jenkins.maxqia.com/job/PoreRT/lastSuccessfulBuild/) into your server's `mods` directory.
4. Make a `plugins` directory in your server's base directory.
5. Copy any of the plugins you want to try into the `plugins` directory.

When you spin up your server look for messages like:

```
[STDERR/sponge]: [name.richardson.james.bukkit.utilities.plugin.AbstractPlugin:onEnable:118]: org.apache.commons.lang3.NotImplementedException: TODO
```   

These aren't an indication that a feature is broken, but that a feature needed for the plugin you're loading hasn't been implemented yet.

## Compilation

Gradle is used to handle dependencies.

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MineWorldProgram/PoreRT.git`
- Navigate to the new directory: `cd PoreRT`
- Update the Submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Compile the project using the Gradle wrapper: `./gradlew` (`gradlew` on Windows)

## Running

You can run and debug Pore directly in your IDE if you setup your workspace like described in the following steps:

1. Setup the PoreRT project as described in
[Plugin Debugging and Hotswapping (SpongeDocs)](https://docs.spongepowered.org/en/plugin/debugging.html)
2. Create a **new** run configuration with the same settings as described in the link above, but add this as a program
argument: `--tweakClass blue.lapis.pore.tweaker.RemapTweaker`
3. Run the server as usual. PoreRT should load and you should be able to debug in your IDE.

### Configuring the annotation processor

Pore uses an annotation processor for event registration. It will be run by the Gradle wrapper by default and IDEA when
the project is first built, but if you wish to make changes to event registration, the IDE must be configured to run it
on project rebuild. If you don't know what event registration means, skip this step.

For IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open `File`->`Settings`->`Build, Execution, and Deployment`->`Compiler`->`Annotation Processors`.
2. Click the `Add` (plus) button and name the new profile `Pore AP`.
3. Click the `Pore` module under the `Default` profile and click the `Move to` button to move it to the `Pore AP`
profile.
4. In the `Processor FQ Name` pane, click the `Add` button and enter the following:
`blue.lapis.pore.event.EventProcessor`
5. Click `Apply`. The processor will be run when the project is rebuilt (`Build`->`Rebuild Project`).
